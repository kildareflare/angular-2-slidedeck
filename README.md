# angular-2-slidedeck
An Angular 2 version of angular-slidedeck.

This repo accompanies a series of blog posts, written as I learn Angular 2.
The posts describe how I have converted the original Angular 1 repository "angular-slidedeck" - https://github.com/paperhive/angular-slidedeck to Angular 2.

In addition to exploring Angular 2 this series of blog posts also looks at TypeScript, JSPM and VSCode.
